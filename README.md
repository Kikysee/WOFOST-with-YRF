# WOFOST with YRF
This repository introduces the yield reduction factor added to the WOFOST model, its function, and how it modifies carbon dioxide assimilation.

This repository provides an implementation of a data assimilation framework for the PCSE crop modelling environment. The core code is adapted from Allard de Wit’s PCSE notebooks (see https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse_notebooks
).

To use this implementation, simply replace the assimilation.py module in PCSE with the assimilation file from this repository.

For a full description of the methodology, experimental setup, and evaluation, please refer to the associated publication. The citation and link to the paper will be added here once the manuscript is accepted.
